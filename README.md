# About data georeferenced exceeding nominal

Nominal data is the reference, for level 2 dataset a lowering of
georeferenced data has to be made.

# About strata in georeferenced not appearing in nominal

As some are aggregation or resulting from a desaggregation in nominal
and not in georeferenced, we will try to produce a desaggregated data
for georeferenced data to match nominal.

# About strata with double units but spatial footprint not matching

The duplication of a strata is to take in account the
geographic\_identifier. Then the duplicated stratas will be removed and
the not duplicated are kept and then converted. Following work to
analysis this new treatment is to be done.
