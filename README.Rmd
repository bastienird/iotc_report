# About data georeferenced exceeding nominal

Nominal data is the reference, for level 2 dataset a lowering of georeferenced data has to be made. 

# About strata in georeferenced not appearing in nominal

As some are aggregation or resulting from a desaggregation in nominal and not in georeferenced, we will try to produce a desaggregated data for georeferenced data to match nominal. 

# About strata with double units but spatial footprint not matching

The duplication of a strata is to take in account the geographic_identifier. Then the duplicated stratas will be removed and the not duplicated are kept and then converted. Following work to analysis this new treatment is to be done.
