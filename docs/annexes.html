<p>L’apparition de strates par rapport à la comparaison précédente espèces/années nous permet de faire l’hypothèse qu’il y a un report des données d’un certain engin sur d’autres (faisant que la somme pour années/espèces n’est pas sup au nom). Si c’est le cas, faut-il garder cette représentation de chaque engin pour chaque classe ou juste retirer la dimension engins pour certaines strates car les nominales ne se correspondent pas. Si on ajoute les données sans correspondance ou inférieures on obtient un total de 4.7972762^{6} tonnes, il n’y a ni “99.9” ni données aggregées du type TUN, TUS, BIL dans les nominales qui peuvent expliquer ces problèmes.</p>
<p>L’aggregation ou les données en gear 99.9 ne permettent pas d’expliquer ni les georef no nominales, ni les georef_sup_nom</p>
<p>On regarde la disposition temporelle pour les strates sans fishing_fleet pour voir l’impact de l’ajout ou du retrait de cette dimension i.e. la possibilité de report des captures d’une fishing_fleet sur une autre.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Les deux courbes sont sensiblement identiques, le problème n’est donc pas augmenté par la dimension fishing_fleet. Donc le problème vient pas d’un report des données d’un fishing_fleet à un autre. On regarde les strates c(species, fishing_fleet, year) pour voir si le report pourrait plutôt être expliqué entre les gear_type (ce qu’on n’intuitait pas au début).</p>
